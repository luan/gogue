X maps shouldn't need to know about player (game should)
X maps shouldn't have a player (it is a walkable field after all)

X [game moves player] player can move (not to obstacles [i.e. not walkable])
X floors (Z)
/ [static-ish methods] maps tiles have properties (walkable?, ...)
X network play (client/server)
X port clients to termbox-go
X asynchronous network communication
X asynchronous event loop
X multi-player
/ [need readme] cross compile client - need to install go from source
rewrite server - structure and TDD
well defined protocol (with shared protocol package)
map from file
proper logging
keys and doors
inventory
game validates whether player starts on walkable (error if not)
authentication
save state
