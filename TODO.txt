X maps shouldn't need to know about player (game should)
X maps shouldn't have a player (it is a walkable field after all)
X game ends when goal reached
X [game moves player] player can move (not to obstacles [i.e. not walkable])
X floors (Z)
/ [static-ish methods] maps tiles have properties (walkable?, ...)
X network play (client/server)
X port clients to termbox-go
X asynchronous network communication
X asynchronous event loop
well defined protocol (with shared protocol package)
map from file
proper logging
multi-player
cross compile client
collision
keys and doors
inventory
uneven maps
game validates whether player starts on walkable (error if not)
